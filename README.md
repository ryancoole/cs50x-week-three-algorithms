# CS50x - Week 3: Algorithms

This repo contains my solutions for **Week 3** of Harvard's [CS50x](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) course. The focus this week was on learning the basics of the **algorithms**, including:

- Linear Search
- Binary Search
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Call Stacks
- Recursion
- Merge Sort

## ✅ Projects

### `sort`

In this problem, I analysed three (compiled!) sorting programs to determine which algorithms they use. In a file called `answers.txt` in a folder called `sort`, I recorded my answers, along with an explanation for each program.

### `plurality`

In a file called `plurality.c` in a folder called `plurality`, I implemented a program that runs a **plurality election** (first-past-the-post). Each voter casts one vote for a candidate, and the candidate(s) with the most votes are declared the winner(s). The program records votes, rejects invalid inputs, and correctly handles ties by printing all winners.

### `tideman`

The Tideman voting method (also known as “ranked pairs”) is a ranked-choice voting method that’s guaranteed to produce the Condorcet winner of the election if one exists. In a file called `tideman.c` in a folder called `tideman`, I created a program to simulate an election by the Tideman voting method.
